## Jupyter Notebooks

If you plan to write code in Python or use Python-based software, you need to use some type of python interpreter.  One option is to use a *Jupyter notebook*.  A Jupyter notebook is a python interpreter that lets you combine text, code, and images all in one file.  Jupyter notebook is installed automatically if you installed the full Anaconda package.

To start a Jupyter notebook, in the Terminal window, type
```
$ jupyter notebook
```
It may take a few seconds to load the page, especially if it is the first time you have ever used the Jupyter notebook, so don't panic if nothing loads for a few seconds.  Then a new window should open in your default internet browser. In the upper right hand corner, click New, then choose Python 3 from the dropdown list (shown below) and this will start a new Jupyter notebook using Python 3.
