## Anaconda
[Python](https://python.org/) is a popular language for scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as well. Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be a bit difficult, however, so we recommend the all-in-one installer [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).  

Anaconda has easy to use installers for Windows, Mac, and Linux.  It installs a lot of the most commonly used packages for you automatically.

### Installing
#### Windows - [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQ0mzZ8UvA)

1. Open the [Anaconda Windows download page](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows).
2. Download the installer.  **Be sure you get the Python 3 version.**
3. Double-click the installer icon and follow the setup instructions on screen.  You can use MOST of the default options.  The only exception is to check the **Make Anaconda the default Python** option.

#### Mac OS X - [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcSAln46u9U)

1. Open the [Anaconda MacOS download page](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos).
2. Download the installer. **Be sure you get the Python 3 version.**
3. Double click the installer icon and follow the setup instructions.  You can use all of the default options.

Anaconda is a very large package and it can take up to an hour to install everything.  If you need to save space, you can install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) instead, but then you will now have to install each package that you want individually.

If you have the time and space on your computer, installing the full version of anaconda is worthwhile.
