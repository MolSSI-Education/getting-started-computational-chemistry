This lesson by the [Molecular Sciences Software Institute]({{ site.molssi_site }}) (MolSSI) is designed to introduce students, particularly undergraduate students who are just starting computational chemistry research, to useful software and computational tools.  Faculty working with new researchers can use this lesson and the linked resources to train new students and thus reduce their training workload.  

Software specific lessons are provided by the [MolSSI Community Code Partners](https://molssi.org/molssi-community-code-partners/).

If you would like to submit a resource to be considered for inclusion on this page, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/MolSSI-Education/getting-started-computational-chemistry/issues) on our GitHub page.
